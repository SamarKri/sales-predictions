## Cleaning and Exploring the data 
8523 rows and 12 columns

## Explanatory Data Visualization 

- Histogram to view the distributions of various features

The Item_Outlet_Sales Distribution dramatically decreases with greater prices

Perfect correlation equal to 1 for : Item_Weight, Item_Visibility , Item_MRP, Outlet_Establishment_Year & Item_Outlet_Sales.
Moderate correlation equal to 0.57 for : Item_MRP with Item_Outlet_Sales
Very low correlation for : The rest of Items and Outlet_Establishment_Year

The Average outlet sales by product category show that : Seafood & Starchy Food are the best-selling they are rich in carbohydrates, nutrients, fiber and vitamins, they are a real source of energy for the body. They are ideal for physical and mental activities. 
In second order are Fruits and Vegetables & Snack Foods which are the most consumed by most people and thirdly Dairy, Canned & Breads. 
Baking Goods & Soft Drinks are the least sold, may be retailer must change their places in the store and I think that they are not recommended for people with certain diseases.

The Item_MR trend seems very fluctuating over the year in which store was established. The the list price of the product increase between 2000 & 2004 years, it falls sharply in 2008 maybe due to the financial crisis. 
Item_Outlet_Sales trend seems almost stable through these years but it falls very sharply in 1998, maybe some sales of certains products are out of stock or a particular store had an incident in this year.

## Preprocessing for Machine Learning 
Preventing data leakage

## Models Evaluation and Results 

### Linear Regression Model :
- This model performs poorly on the training set and testing set regarding R2 metric, this is a case of high bias (underfit). 
- For RMSE metric, our model is incorrect by about 1,115 thousand dollars. 
### Regression Tree Model :
- This model performs perfect on the training data regarding R2 metric. 
- It performs poorly on the testing data, this is a case of high variance (overfitting). 
- For RMSE metric, our model is incorrect by about 1,5 thousand dollars it penalizes more larger errors than Linear model. 
### Regression Tree Model Tuned :
- The best hyperparameter is  for depth=5.
- The R2 testing score become higher, it grows to 0.595 after tuning. 
- The training (0.604) and test (0.595) results have moved closer to each other. 
- The RMSE score is reduced, this model is incorrect by an average of 1,07 thousand dollars. 
By tunning the decision tree model we have reduced overfitting and RMSE metric

## Recommendations for stakeholders
Item_Outlet_Sales can be improved and must be studied according to certain criteria :
- Increasing the amount of best sellers like seafood.
- Focused on fruits and vegetables beneficial to health by making special offers.
- Decrease the amount of unhealthy items like baking Goods & soft Drinks.
- Have always available items sold at various stores to prevent to avoid stock shortage especially in period of health crisis or eventual war.
- Consider selling online and on social networks.
- Changing the packaging and place in the supermarket.

  ## Future Directions 
  May be change model evaluation such as an improved Random Tree Model and have a better metric results.
